# Decisions

## DEC-0001: Standard-library Python starter

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The starter must be easy for a local Agent to inspect, install and test on
  Python 3.11+ without a large framework surface.
- Decision: Use a `src` layout, `pyproject.toml`, standard-library runtime and
  `unittest`; keep setuptools only as the build backend.
- Consequences: Installation and CI remain small, while advanced JSON Schema,
  database and network features require later explicit decisions.
- Evidence: `pyproject.toml`, `src/lore2mud/`, `tests/`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0002: Canon facts remain outside game rules

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Public code must not bundle third-party novels or confuse source facts with
  invented balance values.
- Decision: Store canon facts in an ignored private layer; game entities may only
  point to them through optional `canon_ref` and `source_chapters`, with adaptation
  choices documented separately.
- Consequences: The engine runs without novel data, and future extraction tools need
  an explicit canon provider and review flow.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/content/models.py`,
  `docs/content_pack_format.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0003: Deterministic authoritative vertical slice

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The first playable version needs stable scenario tests and a clear location
  for all state changes.
- Decision: Keep mutable state in `World`, let commands submit intent, and implement
  deterministic combat and progression in separate domain services.
- Consequences: Tests are repeatable and future clients can reuse the same rules;
  randomness and multiplayer concurrency are intentionally deferred.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/engine/world.py`, `src/lore2mud/combat/`,
  `src/lore2mud/progression/`, `tests/test_commands.py`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0004: Versioned private preprocessing pipeline

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The private source uses a legacy Chinese encoding, has volume headings,
  and repeats some original chapter numbers.
- Decision: Decode with an explicit encoding, use chapter occurrence order for stable
  IDs, track volume labels as metadata, and verify reconstruction before any model
  extraction.
- Consequences: Original chapter labels remain display/source metadata; private
  processing can be repeated safely without overwriting chapters.
- Evidence: `pipeline/split_novel.py`, `pipeline/build_manifest.py`,
  `tests/test_pipeline.py`, private external processing report.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0005: Pause and resume through repository handoff files

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Long-running corpus work and Agent sessions must be stoppable without
  losing the next action or accidentally continuing expensive processing.
- Decision: Treat `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `NEXT_TASK.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, and `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` as the restart contract. A paused project
  has no implicit background work; resumption starts only from the single task in
  `NEXT_TASK.md`.
- Consequences: A fresh session can resume from files and repository evidence, while
  novel scans and model calls never restart automatically.
- Evidence: `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `NEXT_TASK.md`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0006: Versioned local save with atomic writes and strict validation

- Date: 2026-07-28
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The playable loop loses all mutable state on exit. Persistence is needed
  before adding more game systems.
- Decision: Implement a `SaveLoadService` that serializes all mutable World state
  (player, room placements, monster HP) to a versioned JSON file. Use a temp file
  plus `os.replace()` for atomic writes. Validate untrusted saves strictly: format
  version, content-pack identity, key-set equality, reference integrity, duplicate
  detection, numeric ranges, and bool-as-int rejection. Keep serialization in a
  dedicated service layer, not in `CommandProcessor`.
- Consequences: Players can save and load across sessions. Content-pack upgrades
  cleanly reject incompatible saves. Future multi-slot support can reuse the service.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/engine/save.py`, `tests/test_save.py`,
  `src/lore2mud/engine/commands.py`, `src/lore2mud/cli.py`.
- Supersedes: None.
