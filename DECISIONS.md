# Decisions

## DEC-0001: Standard-library Python starter

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The starter must be easy for a local Agent to inspect, install and test on
  Python 3.11+ without a large framework surface.
- Decision: Use a `src` layout, `pyproject.toml`, standard-library runtime and
  `unittest`; keep setuptools only as the build backend.
- Consequences: Installation and CI remain small, while advanced JSON Schema,
  database and network features require later explicit decisions.
- Evidence: `pyproject.toml`, `src/lore2mud/`, `tests/`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0002: Canon facts remain outside game rules

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Public code must not bundle third-party novels or confuse source facts with
  invented balance values.
- Decision: Store canon facts in an ignored private layer; game entities may only
  point to them through optional `canon_ref` and `source_chapters`, with adaptation
  choices documented separately.
- Consequences: The engine runs without novel data, and future extraction tools need
  an explicit canon provider and review flow.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/content/models.py`,
  `docs/content_pack_format.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0003: Deterministic authoritative vertical slice

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The first playable version needs stable scenario tests and a clear location
  for all state changes.
- Decision: Keep mutable state in `World`, let commands submit intent, and implement
  deterministic combat and progression in separate domain services.
- Consequences: Tests are repeatable and future clients can reuse the same rules;
  randomness and multiplayer concurrency are intentionally deferred.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/engine/world.py`, `src/lore2mud/combat/`,
  `src/lore2mud/progression/`, `tests/test_commands.py`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0004: Versioned private preprocessing pipeline

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The private source uses a legacy Chinese encoding, has volume headings,
  and repeats some original chapter numbers.
- Decision: Decode with an explicit encoding, use chapter occurrence order for stable
  IDs, track volume labels as metadata, and verify reconstruction before any model
  extraction.
- Consequences: Original chapter labels remain display/source metadata; private
  processing can be repeated safely without overwriting chapters.
- Evidence: `pipeline/split_novel.py`, `pipeline/build_manifest.py`,
  `tests/test_pipeline.py`, private external processing report.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0005: Pause and resume through repository handoff files

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Long-running corpus work and Agent sessions must be stoppable without
  losing the next action or accidentally continuing expensive processing.
- Decision: Treat `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `NEXT_TASK.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, and `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` as the restart contract. A paused project
  has no implicit background work; resumption starts only from the single task in
  `NEXT_TASK.md`.
- Consequences: A fresh session can resume from files and repository evidence, while
  novel scans and model calls never restart automatically.
- Evidence: `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `NEXT_TASK.md`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0006: Versioned local save with atomic writes and strict validation

- Date: 2026-07-28
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The playable loop loses all mutable state on exit. Persistence is needed
  before adding more game systems.
- Decision: Implement a `SaveLoadService` that serializes all mutable World state
  (player, room placements, monster HP) to a versioned JSON file. Use a temp file
  plus `os.replace()` for atomic writes. Validate untrusted saves strictly: format
  version, content-pack identity, key-set equality, reference integrity, duplicate
  detection, numeric ranges, and bool-as-int rejection. Keep serialization in a
  dedicated service layer, not in `CommandProcessor`.
- Consequences: Players can save and load across sessions. Content-pack upgrades
  cleanly reject incompatible saves. Future multi-slot support can reuse the service.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/engine/save.py`, `tests/test_save.py`,
  `src/lore2mud/engine/commands.py`, `src/lore2mud/cli.py`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0007: Validate CLI with backward-compatible subcommands

- Date: 2026-07-28
- Status: Accepted (revised)
- Context: Content packs need validation without starting the game loop. The
  existing CLI uses `lore2mud --content <dir>` with `--player-name` and
  `--save-dir`. Breaking this would disrupt documented workflows. Additionally,
  `parse_known_args` silently ignores unknown flags, which is unacceptable.
- Decision: Pre-scan argv for a recognised subcommand. If none is found, inject
  `"play"` at the front of argv, then use `parse_args` (not `parse_known_args`)
  so unknown flags always fail. The `validate` subcommand calls
  `validate_content_pack()` (the public validation entry point). Catch
  `OSError` separately and use the unified `[ERROR] 内容包校验失败:` format.
  Fix `_read_json()` to catch `UnicodeDecodeError`.
- Consequences: Old commands (`--content`, `--player-name`, `--save-dir`) all
  keep working. Unknown flags are always rejected. The public validation API is
  used rather than the internal loader. Error output is uniform.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/cli.py`, `tests/test_cli_validate.py`,
  `src/lore2mud/content/loader.py`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0008: Deterministic quest flow with auto-accept

- Date: 2026-07-28
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The engine needs a quest system before implementing items, equipment,
  or dialogue. The demo world has one room, one monster, and one item — ideal for
  a single vertical-slice quest.
- Decision: (a) Auto-accept quests when the player enters the trigger room (no
  explicit `accept` command). (b) Let `World.attack()` evaluate quest conditions
  and grant rewards — `CommandProcessor` only renders outcomes. (c) Limit each
  `target_monster_id` to one quest (enforced by the content loader) to avoid
  ambiguity about which quest completes first. (d) Upgrade save format to version
  2 with a required `quest_states` field; cleanly reject version 1 saves.
- Consequences: Quest state is authoritative in `World`, serializable, and
  validated on load. Adding more quests requires only content JSON changes. The
  one-target-one-quest constraint simplifies completion logic but will need
  revisiting if shared-target quests are ever needed.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/engine/world.py`, `src/lore2mud/engine/save.py`,
  `src/lore2mud/engine/commands.py`, `tests/test_quest.py`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0009: Consumable items with single heal_amount field

- Date: 2026-07-28
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The quest system is complete; the next step before equipment is a
  simple item with a deterministic on-use effect (heal HP). The design must avoid
  illegal field combinations and keep the `World` domain layer as the single
  authority for state changes.
- Decision: (a) Use a single optional `heal_amount: int | None` field on
  `ItemDefinition` and `Item` instead of a `consumable` boolean plus separate
  heal value — `None` means unusable, positive int means heal-and-consume.
  (b) Implement `World.use(item_query)` returning a structured `UseOutcome`
  (item_id, item_name, healed_amount); text rendering stays in `CommandProcessor`.
  (c) Reject use at full HP (no consume) and at HP=0 (no implicit revive).
  (d) Content pack version bumps to 0.2.1; old 0.2.0 saves are cleanly rejected
  by the existing version check in `SaveLoadService`. (e) Save format stays at
  version 2 — item properties are reconstructed from the content pack on load,
  so no new serialization fields are needed.
- Consequences: Items are simpler to define (one optional field). The version bump
  breaks backward compatibility with 0.2.0 saves, which is acceptable and
  documented. Future equipment can extend the same pattern with additional optional
  fields on `ItemDefinition`.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/content/models.py`, `src/lore2mud/engine/world.py`,
  `src/lore2mud/engine/save.py`, `src/lore2mud/engine/commands.py`,
  `examples/original_demo/items.json`, `tests/test_consumable.py`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0010: Equipment system with effective_attack and save v3

- Date: 2026-07-28
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The consumable system is complete; the next step is equippable items
  that modify player stats. The design must avoid mutating base stats, support
  clean save/load round-trips, and maintain backward-compatible version checks.
- Decision: (a) `player.attack` stores base/leveled attack; never modified by
  equipment. (b) `World.effective_attack` dynamically computes
  `player.attack + hand attack_bonus`. (c) `equip`/`unequip` only modify
  `equipped.hand`, never touching `player.attack`. (d) Combat uses
  `effective_attack` via `player_attack` parameter on `resolve_combat_round`.
  (e) Save format upgraded to v3 with required `equipped` field; v2 explicitly
  rejected. (f) Equipment items stay in inventory (simplest model). (g) Content
  pack version bumps to 0.2.2; old 0.2.1 saves rejected. (h) Loader rejects
  illegal combos: slot+heal_amount, attack_bonus without slot, slot without
  attack_bonus. (i) `World.use()` rejects equipped items at domain layer.
- Consequences: Base stats are preserved across equip/unequip cycles. Save
  round-trips are clean because attack includes no equipment bonus. The v3 bump
  breaks backward compatibility with 0.2.1 saves, which is acceptable and
  documented. Future body/head slots can extend `EquippedItems` with the same
  pattern.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/engine/world.py`, `src/lore2mud/engine/save.py`,
  `src/lore2mud/engine/commands.py`, `src/lore2mud/combat/service.py`,
  `src/lore2mud/inventory/models.py`, `tests/test_equipment.py`.
