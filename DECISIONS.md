# Decisions

## DEC-0001: Standard-library Python starter

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The starter must be easy for a local Agent to inspect, install and test on
  Python 3.11+ without a large framework surface.
- Decision: Use a `src` layout, `pyproject.toml`, standard-library runtime and
  `unittest`; keep setuptools only as the build backend.
- Consequences: Installation and CI remain small, while advanced JSON Schema,
  database and network features require later explicit decisions.
- Evidence: `pyproject.toml`, `src/lore2mud/`, `tests/`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0002: Canon facts remain outside game rules

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Public code must not bundle third-party novels or confuse source facts with
  invented balance values.
- Decision: Store canon facts in an ignored private layer; game entities may only
  point to them through optional `canon_ref` and `source_chapters`, with adaptation
  choices documented separately.
- Consequences: The engine runs without novel data, and future extraction tools need
  an explicit canon provider and review flow.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/content/models.py`,
  `docs/content_pack_format.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Supersedes: None.

## DEC-0003: Deterministic authoritative vertical slice

- Date: 2026-07-27
- Status: Accepted
- Context: The first playable version needs stable scenario tests and a clear location
  for all state changes.
- Decision: Keep mutable state in `World`, let commands submit intent, and implement
  deterministic combat and progression in separate domain services.
- Consequences: Tests are repeatable and future clients can reuse the same rules;
  randomness and multiplayer concurrency are intentionally deferred.
- Evidence: `src/lore2mud/engine/world.py`, `src/lore2mud/combat/`,
  `src/lore2mud/progression/`, `tests/test_commands.py`.
- Supersedes: None.
